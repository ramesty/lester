19624	__label2__	4	Y	Books	0982761015	Modernist Cuisine at Home	Great Photos, Interesting Reading but Overwhelming for this Home Cook	Great photos and thought provoking for a home cook. But honestly it is a bit overwhelming for me. I am an avid home cook but these recipes require new equipment, new methods and considerable effort or at least that is my impression. As of now I have only made some of the pestos. In time I intend to do more but I will take it slow.
1864	__label1__	1	N	Toys	B00LPCSAX6	Jenga GIANT Premium Hardwood Game	Very poorly executed	Great idea but very poorly executed.<br />We loved the idea of playing Giant Jenga in our backyard but this is not satisfactory.<br />Yeah, the size is ok but it's not really that big.<br />Note this game does not include a storage bag so it's got nowhere to go once it's unpacked.<br />I have now bought another far superior item.
18922	__label2__	5	Y	Apparel	B002POPMMA	Elegant Moments Women's Sheer Suspender Pantyhose, Black, One Size	Hot stockings	I love these, we all have to wear stockings at some point under a dress or what not but these are just secretly sexy underneath your dress, me and my boyfriend love it.
14163	__label2__	5	Y	Musical Instruments	B007QS47TY	Forestone FUA040 Alto Saxophone	Fantastic Reed	I ordered this with mixed expectations. A lot of people consider these reeds to be thinner than advertised. I agree, however, I found that the reed plays wonderfully like real cane. I play mostly jazz with these, and usually play on a Rico Reserve Classic 3.5 (not a 'jazz' reed, mind you, but my choice for such). This reed has easily replaced them. It is full-bodied, and has a flexibility allowing the reed to vibrate without the harsh buzziness associated with synthetics. Next time, I may try the Forestone Black series of reeds. They're supposed to be firmer.

4295	__label1__	5	Y	Beauty	B00CDAQCAW	Botox Alternative:hyaluronic Acid,15% Matrixyl 3000, 20% Argireline,5 % Vitamin C,repair, Boost Collagen, 1oz Serum by PROTOXYN -X5	Totally appreciated.	From my teen years to my adulthood I have suffered from wrinkles on my face. I didn't know the reason of it but it really disgusted me when I looked in the mirror. I'm in my early 30's and my face looked more like of a 55 year old. I needed immediate assistance and luckily I stumbled across this Botox alternative acid and to be honest, I've never felt more confident in myself. My deep wrinkles are barely noticeable and I've only been using this for a short time. Can't wait some more time to pass and I'll finally look how I wanted to.
4517	__label1__	5	Y	Kitchen	B00KB159JU	Silicone Baking Cups - 24 Cupcake Liners By purpledink - Reusable Bakeware	Strong, stable cases	I was really happy with these - they are a great price, and a decent quality. They have a good strength to them, and are stable when you pour the batter in. You don't need a muffin tray underneath like with some others. Recommend these for sure.
15268	__label2__	5	N	Electronics	B008AWDCDW	SOL REPUBLIC 1102-61 AMPS In-Ear Headphones with 1-Button Remote and Microphone - Black	I was a pretty committed SkullCandy user	I didn't buy these headphones from Amazon but I got it new from our campus bookstore.  Before I started using the SOL AMPS, I was a pretty committed SkullCandy user.  Specifically I had the SkullCandy Ink'd 2 and Smokin' Buds 2.  I honestly didn't have any problem with these except for the occasional times when they will fall apart.  I got the SOL AMPS for fun and I'm really glad I picked them out and this is why...<br /><br />DESIGN<br />I wanted something different from SkullCandy and I thought the style of these looked fun and unique.  The SOL logo on the side definitely looks attractive.  I also like how the buds are angled so you can get a better fit.  I was a little worried about the outer part being abnormally large and odd when they are in my ears, but it doesn't really bother me, and in fact it feels very comfortable...<br /><br />COMFORT<br />These are one of the best fitting ear headphones I've ever tried.  They are so comfortable that I sometimes forget I have them in my ears when the music isn't playing.  While the SkullCandy buds fits me fairly well, they don't fit other people when they ask to borrow my SkullCandy headphones.  However, the fitting of the SOL AMPS is perfect.  It feels very snug.  I have exercised (ex. running on treadmill, weightlifting, biking, etc.) using both SkullCandy and SOL AMPS and the SOL AMPS are superior by far.  I never feel like they are going to fall out no matter how much I sweat or move.  These headphones are definitely a plus in comfort.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY<br />The switch from SkullCandy to SOL AMPS is phenomenal.  I feel like I can hear a crisp sound compared to SkullCandy.  I love SkullCandy and thought it was great but wow these definitely give an additional boost to the bass.  The bass isn't overwhelming and it sounds just right.  I'm a person who listens a WIDE range of music (ex. Electronic, Rap, Country, to Classical) and the quality doesn't sound lost in all of the genres.<br /><br />MIC and VOLUME<br />I've used this for calls and skype and I never have problems talking or hearing people.  I sometimes have to hold the mic portion close to my mouth to make myself clearer but this isn't really a problem for me.  This is definitely a nice feature.<br /><br />Having the controls for the volume is so wonderful.  It definitely eliminates the hassle of taking taking out your phone (I have an iPhone) to adjust the volume or even shuffling music.  I use these buttons (almost as an abuse) because that's how convenient they are.  When I am using the SOL AMPS on the bus or any public areas, I never hear any background noises and in addition I can have the volume high without bothering the person who is next to me.<br /><br />PRICE<br />I bought these for a little more than what it is selling on Amazon.  I think these headphones are definitely worth the price!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a treat to an enjoyable experience.  Good job Sol Republic!
18004	__label2__	5	Y	Furniture	B00GTCL2FU	Best Price Mattress 10-Inch Memory Foam Mattress, Full	Great mattress	best purchase ever! had a bit of a smell but were fine after a day or two. Bought 2 full size, they are very comfortable and arrived early.

The lace loosens many times a day by normal walking pressure and you have to tie it multiple times. The lace has already started fraying at the eyelets in effort to tie them tightly.
7333	__label1__	5	Y	Automotive	B00SIA7HJ6	Bolt Power X5 Mini 8000mAh Portable Car Jump Starter 400 AMP Peak - Emergency Outdoor Portable Power Pack	Little but powerful.	It amazing i can't imagine this portable battery charger and is bundled with a charging adapter which is compatible with major electronic devices. It combines three different functions in a single unit- a car jump starter, LED flashlight and a battery charger (i can charge my smartphone). Weighing at just 1 pound, it can easily fit into one's pocket or a travel bag. you can keep into your glove compartment for weeks and still contain the charge perfectly, i really recommend it.
6696	__label1__	5	N	Home	B00J7Y4D2G	Design Toscano The Great White Shark Wall Mount Trophy Sculpture	garage trophy	I bought this for my son whose hobby is fishing.  He has taken multiple boating trips throughout his lifetime and I thought this would be perfect for his garage. We were both surprised at the size it was. It really is a real trophy!!
996	__label1__	3	N	Toys	B00KS11ETM	VTech Kidizoom Smartwatch, Blue (Discontinued by manufacturer)	Kid loves it, I don't	What really matters I guess is that my son loves it, but I feel like stomping on it when he leaves it hanging around and it goes off by itself. Oh well.
3445	__label1__	1	N	Grocery	B00BG0ZJ0Y	MatchaDNA Organic Powdered Matcha Green Tea, 10 Ounce	An organic SCAM! matchaDNA is NOT CERTIFIED ORGANIC!	It says in the advert &#34;100% USDA organic&#34; but there is NO USDA ORGANIC LOGO on the PACK! The USDA labeling regulations for organic food products state clearly that the USDA organic symbol must be displayed on the pack if a product claims to be USDA certified organic. ‘Accelerated Intelligence Distribution' (the distributors of matchaDNA) also claim in the advert that the matcha is “USDA, SWISS, EU and NOP certified organic”. Again, there are no symbols or evidence on the pack to support their claim (there should be evidence on the pack)! The distributors are MISLEADING customers into thinking that the product is certified organic by two organic certification bodies. Why would you not print the symbols of the organic certification bodies when the regulations say you must? No one is above the law. I think that this is a scam. This is totally unacceptable and unlawful! This gift has to go in the bin!

3979	__label1__	2	N	Video DVD	B001DSNF8C	Casino Royale (Two-Disc Collector's Edition + BD Live) [Blu-ray]	Simply lame	I'm a big James Bond fan. Saw almost all James Bond movies but this one didn't satisfy me at all.<br />The story was simply lame, left the cinema really disappointed.
6828	__label1__	5	N	Automotive	B004OU3DH4	OPT7 Blitz Z-Arc HID Replacement DC Bulbs - 9006 (10000K, Blue) Xenon Light	Delivers as described	Don't know where this product is made, but it surely delivers as described. Had no issues with it and I can see better during night

12565	__label2__	2	N	Kitchen	B005LH3QEY	Cryopak Flexible Ice Pack for Lunch Boxes (2 pack)	They leaked	Agree with others. These leaked and are good for injuries but not lunches. I like the Stayfit containers that have gel in the covers or inside the walls of the container.
18671	__label2__	3	Y	Wireless	B007P7JF52	HTC EVO 3D No Contract Sprint Cell Phone	A little pissed	I thought I was getting a NEW phone. This phone is not new. Didn't come with an SD card, the book that was in the box is not the book for this phone. However seeing as how this is a replacement phone the book is not needed I have two already but that's besides the point. The battery is crap and It doesn't do the same things my other ones did. I am so sad I was really looking forward to having a new phone that worked the same as mine did. LOVE the HTC Evo 3D phone and don't want to get any other kind but this phone was listed as NEW, and its not. Very disappointing. So
3452	__label1__	4	N	Luggage	B002B4K5Z8	Rockland Luggage 19 Inch Tote Bag, Black, One Size	It does not roll	I thought this was a great buy for the price. I love the size of this rolling duffle and it has great pocket space, however it does not roll. The wheels just slide across the floor no matter what the surface. I was a gift to my daughter and she is really disappointed that we will have to be replacing it.
3645	__label1__	3	N	Video Games	B008GEH9HO	Nintendo 3DS XL - Blue/Black	terrible graphics	I recently purchased a DSI XL, because I wanted the larger screen. I soon returned it because of the pixels. It had terrible graphics and just wasn't worth the price. Before I bought my 3DS Xl today, I was hesitant of getting another large nintendo due to the DSI XL.
16553	__label2__	4	Y	Camera	B0044DEEJM	GE DV1-LG Waterproof/Shockproof 1080P Pocket Video Camera (Lime Green) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Hey, its not bad !!	[[VIDEOID:moL9YKOVKD1JWC]]I just got this video camera and I am very happy with it. the videos up load easily to my pc and they look great. one small problem with this camera is that you can't take any video up close to show writing on a package or real close up shots. but besides that it takes some great video. so if this will be your first time buying one of these camera you won't go wrong. and I brought this lime green one because it was cheaper then the new ones that came out of this model, and I didn't want to wait weeks to get it.<br />I took some video at night about 1:00am with just a overhead street light I have in my yard, just wanted you too see how the GE DV1 works with low light. this model is now $66 dollars !!
17696	__label2__	4	Y	Shoes	B000WHRYZA	Clarks Women's Lucena Sandal,Pewter Metallic,5.5 M	Clarks Lucena Sandal	I like the looks of the shoe, but Clark's shoes don't seem to be made as well as they use to be.  The straps when fastened do not cover all of the velcro.  They are too short and do not look really nice.  I wear a small shoe and other than the strap being too short, they fit ok.  I am not returning them because I got a good price and will be ok for wear shopping, around the house, etc.  If you can find these in a local store, try on first to see if strap bothers you.  They are less expensive online.
19449	__label2__	4	Y	Camera	B0043GT9Y0	Neewer 180W 5600K Photo Studio Flash Speedlite Strobe Light Monolight for Studio,Location and Portrait Photography	Works great	Nice bright lights for not much money! I have 3 of them. I use a Cowboy studio trigger to fire one and the other twos slave function and they work perfect. I also get f11 no problem shooting thru umbrellas at about half power.. Which leads to the only real con I can find.. These lights could use more power adjustments

12167	__label2__	5	N	Books	B0006BTYPA	The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades	A marvelous spoof	This is a marvelous spoof book, written in very formal prose, about totally imaginary creatures. (I found a very nice copy at a garage sale selling for a dollar, 50 cents after a bit of bargaining).<br /><br />This was reprinted by The University of Chicago Press with the following legend: &#34;The Snouters was originally published in Germany, under the title Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia, by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart in 1957. Copyright � 1964 by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart. Portions of the book appeared in Natural History magazine in April 1967 and is reprinted here with permission. The 15 plates and 12 text figures in this volume were drawn by Gerolf Steiner. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 60637 The University of Chicago Press, Ltd., London.<br /><br />Maggie Koerth-Baker recently wrote a blog post about the book; the picture she refers to can be found by googling Maggie Koerth-Baker imaginary animals.<br /><br />&#34;In this dusty display box at the University of Maine sits the carefully preserved skeleton of a small, shrew-like rodent which, lacking hind legs, propelled itself along with the help of a long, jointed nose-foot. If that seems a bit too whimsical to be true, well, it is. The creature belongs to the mammalian order Rhinogradentia – an entirely made-up class of animals. Like this specimen, which belongs to UMaine professor Irving Kornfield, the rhinogrades are all rodents and they all have some sort of fantastic nasal appendage ... and, most importantly, none of them actually exist.<br /><br />&#34;Now, there are plenty of imaginary animals in the world and, some of them – like the jackalope, for instance – exist in taxidermy and skeletal form despite not existing as living beings. But most of those are folk-crafts, their origins steeped in tall tales or intentionally profitable efforts to mislead, and their inventors lost to time. Rhinogradentia, on the other hand, is relatively new. It was created in 1961 by a real German zoologist named Gerolf Steiner who wanted to illustrate the way evolution can create diversity in isolated populations. In order to do that, Steiner created a fake German zoologist called Harald Stümpke, a fake island chain called Hy-yi-yi, and a fake order of mammals with funny noses. And then he wrote a book about it.<br /><br />&#34; Published under Stümpke's name, The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades, is meant to read like a totally serious zoology handbook of the time period. It's a parody that absolutely refuses to wink at you, and it's become a bit of an in-joke among biologists. This particular specimen was actually built by Kornfield, himself, using real animal bones and illustrations from Stümpke/Steiner's book.&#34;<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the book, and enjoyed reading both Maggie Koerth-Baker's description and the marvelous Reviews here on Amazon even more. My only problem is how to dispose of the book, now that I am down sizing my life.<br /><br />Robert C. Ross<br />March 2015

Upgraded from CTK2400, where the piano tones were ok, but the other instruments and accompaniments not so much.  This model fixes all that and does so much more!

11829	__label2__	4	N	Musical Instruments	B000Z7C9T8	Yamaha MG102C 10 Input Stereo Mixer	Fits my needs and budget	I needed a mixer for my home studio and this one has all that I need to start out. The fact that it has two channels of compression is nice and the four mic preamps will cover all my needs for now. My only complaint is that I wish the output to amp was xlr or balanced 1/4" instead of instrument cable 1/4". Other than that I feel like I chose the best mixer between Behrenger, Mackie, Souncraft and Yamaha for 99 USD!
18827	__label2__	4	Y	Home	B008MLWM4Q	uxcell Embroidered Flower Pattern Cloth Folding Hand Fan Colored Black	works wonderfully	This fan works great at work when I have hot flashes, it really moves the air.

20085	__label2__	5	Y	Watches	B0000TIIVE	Timex Men's T44381 Expedition Metal Field Brown Leather Strap Watch	Quality watch especially for price	Great watch especially for the price Amazon sells it..  This specific watch I bought a week or so ago is actually my backup T44381 in case my original ever breaks or gets to a point it won't work anymore.  Figure for $30 or so, its not a big expense.. My original I've worn for over 8 years with no difficulties or problems other than normal battery and strap replacement.  Overall a good quality watch you can wear while doing normal everyday things and not have to worry about

It is the most gorgeous piece in the salon.  It is sturdy for sitting and wipes off easy of a small mark gets on it.  The jewels set in it are about the size of a quarter and perfectly placed so it is some good bling but not overdone.  It is my favorite piece!

I'm *that* much of a banana bread lover!  This White Post Farm banana bread is the stuff I've always admired the most, but I'm particularly fond of the homemade stuff too.  Seriously, an Amish store downtown was selling several loaves of banana bread in a giant bin.  I noticed them the moment I walked inside.  I nearly cried with excitement... and cried more when I came back a few weeks later and they were all gone. Banana bread is my best and only friend.  It just goes down my throat so well.

To me these are a time-saver from filling them to freezer.<br />I bought mine through Ebay at a good price.<br />I recommend these because they are fast and dependable and i'm very happy with them.<br />Very ingenious idea for putting covers over the water and mine don't leak either.<br />I'm now using these over my ice cube making machine that's how much i enjoy these.
20577	__label2__	4	N	Books	0345547357	Power Score: Your Formula for Leadership Success	What Is Your Score?	So what is your Power Score?<br /><br />On a scale of 1 to 10 how well have you laid out the priorities of your organization and is everyone on board with them and for them.<br /><br />Multiply that number by<br /><br />One a scale of 1 to 10 on what percentage of people in your organization are “A players”?  0% to 100%.  These are people who are in the right job and contribute positively to the organizations culture.<br /><br />Then multiply that number by the condition of your organizations relationship.  Relationships between employees, between management and labor, between the organization and its customers and suppliers.<br /><br />The perfect number you can have is 1000, but that is probably impossible.  A number of 729 means you are running at full power.  500 to 700 means you are doing pretty well.  Below 500 you need to do some work.<br /><br />That is the premise of the Power Score.  The book is written in a question and answer format, the authors asking the questions they believe the reader would ask and then answering them.  It actually makes for an easy read and makes it easy to explain some of their more complex thoughts.  Overall there is nothing earth shattering in this book, it all comes down to basic common business sense, the authors just organize it in very thoughtful way, and they support all of their claims with references a large pool of research they are pulling from.  They offer ideas and strategies to improve your score in all three of the categories.<br /><br />So I don’t think this book offers any earth shattering ideas, it is full of a lot of good ones.  Worth a read if you are in a position to alter your organization for the better.

What is pictured is the BLACK labeled for sale and under sellers or Amazon.com have no idea about these things maybe. They also have the greatest hit. So this pretty much is lieing to US the consumer about the product we are trying or about to purchase. Everyone just watch out because if you want the BLACK label game and you may receive the GREATEST HITS version of the game.

Rarely do you find a biography this well-written. When you finish this book you have to ask yourself: What kind of person works hard to get out of poverty and then becomes so obsessed with a cause that he gives up everything he has worked for, a loving wife and family, a lucrative business, his dignity, and any income at all to follow a cause that he feels only he can accomplish. Author Timothy Egan has given us a great gift in writing this biography.

Nice to purchase something from a company that is globally conscious.  The corn resin case is durable, the strap is comfortable (I have a small wrist and the holes are in the right place!) the face is easy to read, and the colors are fun.  I was sorry this color did not come in the felt strap, as I have another watch with that feature and it is my favorite for comfort and fit.  One note: I did not notice (or it was not posted) that the strap has a metal buckle; many of their watches have plastic or resin.  I sometimes have an allergic reaction to metal on watch bands, but so far this has not been a problem.

This is great for a quick clean up, light dust removal and works as advertised. Looks like you just did a hard wax of your car in 1/4 of the time. Last for a couple of weeks.Goes on easy, wipes off fast. Follow the instructions and you cannot go wrong, This product is as good as it says it is, highly recommended.

5013	__label1__	5	N	Home Entertainment	B00SSG0AJO	VIZIO E500I-B1R 50-Inch 1080p LED Smart TV (Refurbished)	Good TV for the price..	I just lost my Samsung 46 inch top of the line when after only 3 years the picture developed a bad screen. Broke my heart but I realized even Samsung gets bad parts now and then. It's a good TV otherwise http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0071NWYP8  I take super care of my electronics as I kept this LCD in new condition right up to its death. Three years? I told the Samsung rep on the phone. He just said it was out of warranty, so long story short I decided against another Samsung.  The vizio rep happened to be there and he pointed out that they re-vamped all the smart apps and told me of the new back-lit 12 panel led zone, which even the 2013 high tech &#34;M&#34; series didn't have. After fiddling with the contrast and temp colors I was able to get a fantastic picture.Bought it, brought it home and set it up.Wow! I was pretty impressed to find a $700 TV that can go up against a $1500 TV. And then you toss in a referbished TV for $500 and you've got yourself a deal! http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SSG0AJO  Vizio also now has a smaller front frame edge measureing 10mm. only 2 mm less than last year but it makes for an almost invisable frame. Another bonus... I had a good experience mounting it with this http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B000WYVBR0  I did a solid week of reading reviews and numerous visits to my local stores watching and adjusting several brands before deciding on a 55 inch LG or Vizio as my choices. I hated the new LG's magic remote( works like a mouse on the screen) but I also heard that the Vizio had lame apps on their smart E & the better M series.  Just last week I walked into my local &#34;S&#34; club and a guy was setting up the new 2014 E series B-2. He told me they were the first to get them.  Vizio ups the speaker wattage from 10 to 15 watts. Not mindblowing but way improved from the muffled speaker sound that is associated with most down pointed speakers that seems to be standard with most HGTV's. Bottom line I love it. Its good to see a company like Vizio upping their game with internal improvements instead of a cosmetic makeover like a lot of other companies.  Save some cash, get yourself a good as new TV! http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SSG0AJO

The second time around I decided to go big and it is working out ok. The problem with this company is that they seem incapable of producing a lid that fits correctly. You have to hold it in place when pouring (it doesn't fit snugly; one end always sticks up). Same thing occurred with first one I owned. And yes, they were that way right out of the package. Quality control is sorely lacking at Brita. But for the price, the filter does its job so it's an acceptable product and I will keep it.

19573	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B00002ZMNO	Time Out with Britney Spears	The good old Britney...	When watching this video, you will see why it was easier for people to fall in love with Britney back then because she had this bubbly, sweet, girly, and cheery personality with a preppy, soft, baby like voice. When she performs on stage, she smiles and friendly engages with the crowd. She mostly rambles about in this video on how she got started with dancing, the MMC, her hometown, and working on her first album and music videos. I do admit that hearing songs like Sometimes and From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart does take me back to middle school and how nice and innocent those days were. I actually like those songs better than Baby One More Time. As mushy and corny those songs can be, I did enjoyed the sweet sentiment of those songs. I think after she broke up with Justin, you could definitely see the changes in her personality and behavior. She started doing really stupid things, but I guess she kinda wise up from her mistakes now that she's older. I think this DVD is good for people who are just starting to like Britney and her music, and for people who are generally feeling nostalgic about their school days in the 90s and the bubblegum pop era.

Not well engineered!<br />Item received was short 1 piece for rear window, and the fit requires the bottom of the vent to rest with force on your weather stripping with a sharp edge that cuts into your weatherstrip which the manufacturer jokingly attempted to remediate with a piece of tape; now I have my outside weatherstrip with cuts in it, where it was perfect prior now I can only cover three windows, not four because of poor quality control. Amazon will not let me return this item, but it is my fault because I did not open the box for over a month while I was waiting for other work to be completed on my 06 jeep liberty. I am so done with Amazon, and I have ordered lots from them!<br /><br />Issue update:<br />I did speak with amazon and they are letting me return this item, but my comments on the engineering still stand. Also amazon should make it easier to find a customer service phone #, it is frustrating to rummage around their website where they keep it buried, it was much easier to google their #, then speak to a customer service rep.

I think I have bought every pillow on the market, and not a single one has helped with my tossing and turning .  I was buying a satin pillowcase to keep my hair from breaking at night, and this strange pillow popped up in my search.  It didn't look like any of the 5,000 others I've tried, so I figured, why not?  BEST DECISION EVER!!!!!  After a few nights of getting used to it, I now sleep through the night!  I never would have believed that the shape of my pillow was causing my sleeping issues, but apparently it was! As far as wrinkles go, I'm not sure.  I have the "11" in between the brows, I don't think the pillow can help those.  I'm sure if you had crow's feet this pillow would be helpful.  If I escape developing them after using this pillow for 10 years, I'll come back to update,and give all the credit to this pillow, lol

I'm enjoying swimming more often now compared before, i hate latex and I'll never wear one again. Silicone is the thing because it's comfortable to use, doesn't wear out easily and it's cheaper. This cap is durable and very good at keep my hair dry, I love the style as well and the toughness of the silicone. I'll be recommending it to my friends!
18208	__label2__	1	Y	Home	B002DGM4IU	Whitmor 6779-3044 Double Rod Freestanding Closet with Steel and Resin Frame, 45.2 by 68-Inch, Silver	Cheap product, poorly made.	This product is so poorly made, I wasn't even able to assemble it.  There are no tools required for assembling it.  All the parts are supposed to easily slide together.  Except that they don't.  The holes in the black plastic parts aren't large enough to allow the rods to slide in.  And when I tried to pull it apart, it snapped in half.  This was a waste of time and money.  The lesson, as always, is that you get what you pay for.  I'm going to IKEA next time.

11400	__label2__	5	Y	Video DVD	B00B1RB8FC	Last Exile: Fam, The Silver Wing, Season 2, Part 2 [Blu-ray]	An Entertaining Finale And Enjoyable Sequel	While the new cast for this sequel are as endearing as the previous LE the overall storyplot and villains and hero's also feels just the same as well. That's not to say the series is boring far from it you do wish though that they made the personalities of the character protagonist a little more original though with most animes and some shows that's pretty hard to do nowadays. I give kudos to keeping the animation the same as the previous LE and soundtrack score also fits nicely with the series,also you do get a special treat if you saw the first LE series as we see the return and cameos of characters from that series which is appreciated. The voice cast for both the Japanese subbed and English dubbed did a great job though with some of the previous LE characters they will of course sound somewhat different in the dub audio as the original voice actors and actress couldn't or wouldn't come back to dub their character voices though the people picked to dub those characters did a stellar job.<br /><br />So if you already have the first Last Exile series then this is a must have to add on to your anime collection or if you're just looking for a good anime series in general....

Otherwise, the flowers are healthy.  I ordered the same color zinnia from another vendor as well with the same results, so I'm guessing this particular color of zinnia is not guaranteed.  I would not order this product again as they are not as vibrant as I would have liked.
13015	__label2__	5	Y	Lawn and Garden	B006TLL1HA	Toro 51480 Corded 14-Inch Electric Trimmer/Edger	Good Product	Over the years, I've owned several trimmers, both electric and gas - this one ranks at the top of the list.  It was easy to assemble, and powerful enough to cut fairly thick/high grass and weeds.  The &#34;edger&#34; function is one of the better I've seen/used - the motor/cutter head assembly easily swivels 90 degrees, and the small wheel keeps it at just the right height for edging along the driveway and curb.  About the only drawback would be the weight of this trimmer.  It is well made and somewhat heavy - so, for those of you who want something light, this is not it.

20249	__label2__	5	N	Home Entertainment	B00080FPRU	Sony DVP-NS50P/S Single DVD Player, Silver	Great player, great feature and lots of very nice features not to mention they seem to last forever	Very good DVD player, every output except HDMI(oh and optical audio) including Composite, S-video, Component, L&R audio and coax audio.<br />The NS-50 like the NS-41 not only have full display of times(chapter, title, elapsed and remaining) but hold onto remaining for titles that may not support it, as long as you activate remaining on at least one title on the disc that supports remaining time. IOW some discs may not support remaining time on the main title but things like extras may support it. If you activate remaining time in a extra, when you go back to the main title remaining will stick.<br />Another thing I like about the NS-50 and also NS-41(basically identical to the NS-50 from what I've found) is they both have full picture controls: Brightness, Contrast, Color, etc.<br />Like most all Sony DVD players this one has  a 6 disc resume feature that remembers where you left off for the last 6 discs where you've saved a resume(to not save a resume simply push STOP STOP before ejecting the disc). Resuming is as simple as inserting a disc and pressing PLAY or pushing PLAY when the tray is open and it will close and start at the resume point.<br />This player has PLAY, EJECT, STOP, PAUSE and SKIP forward and SKIP rev on the main unit, other features are accessed from the remote.<br />On the remote it has speed play where you can play a disc in anywhere from .6 to 1.4x speed with audio. Full slow motion as well as frame advance is also available, not to mention time search where you can easily enter any time and the player will jump to it.<br />I have several of these and they seem to last forever not to mention they are quite good at playing scratched discs as well as all burnt discs including DL's. Unfortunatly the only video format this player supports is MPEG2, the most common DVD standard, no Divx or other computer type formats.

There weren't any that looked good, were thin and lightweight and had a working stand. Then I found this case and I can't be more happy. I attend a number of meetings and needed a case that worked well while I use SuperNote Pro. Adaptive positioning with the case simple. The case is constructed well and my Tab seems to be well protected.

10578	__label2__	5	Y	Video Games	B00KWG4HG0	Mario Party 10	Five stars all the way	This wii title has been a big hit at my home, with family and friends when they come over as well as just us here at home.  Nice to get a group of four together I've found.  Lots of fun.  Playable even for those who don't really play video games.  I find that nice because I have a young video game enthusiast who likes to drag either willing or non-willing people in for a round of this!  Nice you can choose the length of time you wish to play too.
10675	__label2__	2	N	Video DVD	B00AEFYQE2	No Strings Attached	Not funny, without any romantism included, wasting two good actors, this is almost the "level zero" of romantic comedies	I didn't like this film at all and count it as one of my most disappointing viewings ever - and that came as an unpleasant surprise, considering the names of actors and the director. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) unwillingly keep running into each other - until one day they get really close... Emma however is reluctant to the very idea of a relationship and asks for a &#34;sex only - no strings attached&#34; common operation. Adam, who is much less cynical, agrees after some hesitation (and we can totally understand him - after all, this is Natalie Portman who asks, for God's sake...). Of course, things will not go as smoothly as it is supposed.<br /><br />The general idea wasn't the easiest thing in the world to be handled, I must give that to the director. But Ivan Reitman, even if he didn't make a really good film since &#34;Ghostbusters&#34; in 1984, is an experienced veteran and he could definitely do better than that.<br /><br />The scenario is weak and the potential of both main actors is wasted. There is a couple of jokes, but they mostly turn around Adam's dad, an aging playboy played by Kevin Kline. For the most of time this film is definitely NOT funny - and that is rarely good news for a comedy. As for the romance, well, there is hardly any - I saw more romantism in some butcher shops...<br /><br />I give this film two stars only because I generally like Ashton Kutcher (I found him particularly good in &#34;Butterfly Effect&#34;, &#34;The Guardian&#34;, &#34;My boss's daughter&#34; and &#34;A lot like love&#34;) and of course I would watch Natalie Portman in ANYTHING... But this not-funny, not-romantic, occasionally vulgar film was for me a TERRRRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT, nowhere near the quality of &#34;Notting Hill&#34;, &#34;While you were sleeping&#34;, &#34;When Harry meets Sally&#34; or &#34;Must love dogs&#34; - gosh, it wasn't even anywhere near the level of &#34;A lot like love&#34; (a lesser, albeit honest film). I am glad that I rented it instead of buying. AVOID!
5727	__label1__	5	N	Books	0307476073	Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail	Excellent book.	What's with people saying the book was bad because the main character was selfish and stupid in her decisions? Do you honestly think this book would be compelling to read if the main character was the perfect character, Mother Teresa, expert backpacker? Name one piece of good literature where the main character is perfect. Would you prefer if Cheryl lied and talked about how perfect she was and how smooth the journey was? Some of the reviews of this book I've read on goodreads are a perfect example of how annoyingly judgmental human beings are.

And the individual sheets of paper tear across the top with perforations, rather than a &#34;gummed&#34; top.<br /><br />This paper is thick enough so that I can use my large-tipped roller ball pens on it without the ink &#34;soaking through&#34; the paper to the other side of the paper.<br /><br />And, amazon sent the paper right to my front door, which is certainly a convenience, saving me having to go out and buy the pads of paper at the same or even higher price.

If you're in the HR department of such a company it should probably be required reading. This book explains the value of employees to a company and thus the HR department. Money spent on HR is not money down the drain, but money well spent the author argues and from what I've read of his book, he's probably right.

4868	__label1__	5	Y	Grocery	B0009F3SBE	Yogi Teas Energy Green Tea, 16 Count (Pack of 6)	Great taste, good energy	This tea is quite good and when you add to the fact that it also provides a nice burst of energy, you have yourself a winning green tea in my book.  I usually drink it cold, although it tastes good hot too.  I drink tea daily, mostly for the taste and energy, but I am always happy to add antioxidants to the body whenever I can.<br /><br />I will also drink black tea which usually has a higher caffeine content for energy; [[ASIN:B00IDXDQ9I All Natural Organic - High Energy Caffeine Instant Black Tea Powder (Over 100 Servings Per Package) - Buy One Get One Free!]].  I do like the taste of the green tea better, but when it comes to using it as a source of energy, black tea still performs better for me.  This is also probably due to the fact that the instant black tea powder I use doesn't come in bags so it is easier to make a "strong" cup.  I will usually fill a large water bottle (about a quart) and add two heaping teaspoons of the tea powder, and sip throughout the day.  This works out to be a ton of caffeine but it keeps me wired like no other.<br /><br />This is why I like this green tea that comes with the ginseng so much.  It is not sooo much caffeine and I am using another source of energy besides just the caffeine content.  The ginseng, I'm sure, is what makes it so much more expensive but since I do not drink it every day, I think it is not that bad.

But since I paid premium for these leggings, I thought I would give it a shot. So I went to the Gym in them and every single guy and girl kept telling me that these the portion in the back were way too transparent and were able to see through. I have to admit that I do not like to wear underwear when I use leggings, so you can imagine what was the reaction.<br /><br />I felt so embarrassed, these leggings are are revealing in the back, since I couldn't tell from the front much. I will have to trow these leggings to the trash, not work everyone making funny faces at me.

8303	__label1__	5	N	Home Improvement	B00JOBJUI4	Frostfire Winter 16 Bright LED Wireless Solar Powered Motion Sensor Light (Weatherproof, no batteries required)	Great garden light	If you're looking for a solution for an outdoor light that basically takes care of itself without the need of a mains electric power source then look no further! Once activated and put in place, this light offers an ample amount of light for highlighting those areas which are a little too dark when the sun goes down. I ordered two of these and have one right above my front door (for finding my keys that bit easier when I arrive home), and also one by my gate (so anyone coming in at night has some light to illuminate the path to the door). Let's also not forget they are a good security option for informing you of people approaching when put out of arms reach. The light gives off a dim glow throughout the night and switches to a really bright LED option when the motion sensor picks up movement. The light then turns back to it's dim setting around 10 seconds after. Perfect! The best part about these is their green energy efficiency where they charge throughout the day via the solar panel on the top of them. I'm going to be buying another one of these and I highly recommend them as a cheap option to solve your night time exterior light problems and also to add a dash of security to areas of your property.

They leave a weird film, and just don't taste like real creamer/half & half/etc.  This Nescafe, however, is actually pretty good.  It's a nice alternative for the office.

I like how this case is really slim yet protective for my new phone. Whenever I drop it on the floor, I am surprised there were no cracks. I examined the case carefully and noticed that there raised edges on the front and back that prevents the screen and camera lens from touching the surface. I found this such an adavantageous feature. No other case will possess this feature.

18846	__label2__	5	Y	Musical Instruments	B00DRFSYOE	Eartec Simultalk 24G Wireless System Full Duplex 2 Station Setup With Two Cyber Headsets	Really Like These Radios!	My son and I use these while sailing to communicate over wind noises and him being 40-45 feet away from me at times raising sails or dropping anchor.  The full duplex feature is very useful as we can communicate without stepping on each other's transmission.  We were able to carry on a dialogue while anchoring off which would have been impossible with us waving and yelling to each other.  We found we kept them on while we were both in the cockpit simply because we could hear and understand each other better.  We are looking at adding another remote; however, the lack of communication between remotes may present a problem - the &#34;remotes&#34; can only talk to the &#34;master,&#34; so the master would have to relay communications between the remotes.  Other than that, it's a really nice piece of technology.

12251	__label2__	4	Y	Apparel	B00EIFGP0W	Status Men's Trac Belt, Black, 36	Status Men's Trac Belt 36"	I bought this belt because I liked the idea of a belt with no holes . It allows for a more finite adjustment for size. The belt is very well made with good quality leather and the buckle has a spring device with a release lever on the underside. Herein is where the problem lies. I tried the belt on and as expected I got a great fit, however, when I tried to release the belt,it would not. As hard as I tried,it I could not get it to release. I finally had to force the belt over my hips and step out of it to get it off. Inspecting the buckle, I could see no reason for the hang up so I tried adjusting the metal tab that locks in the adjustment and after several re-adjustments I got the belt to release reasonably well. On the plus side, this was one of a few no hole belts that you can order by size and not have to cut back to eliminate the excess leather. I ordered the recommended 2 sizes larger than my waist size and that worked perfectly. Perhaps my belt was defective, needing this re-adjustment but I guess I won't know because I decided against the hassle of a return.    On 2/27/15 I decided to amend my review. I raised it from 2 stars to 4 stars. Since I made my own adjustment to the buckle, the release mechanism is working just fine and the belt is holding up well.I did not give it 5 stars because of the adjustment I was forced to make. I would recommend this belt but with a caveat on the buckle.

For those times when you just want one (or two) cups, and are in a bit of a hurry, this is especially nice. The lemon & bergamont flavors are well balanced. I've always been a Twinings Earl Grey fan; I think the Capital Teas brand is also delicious. Yes, it's a bit pricey. It's also organic which is probably why.

16621	__label2__	1	Y	Video Games	B00CX8VYM0	Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag	Amazon Cruel to Children Rip Off	Game is great... Amazon, not so much. Buyer beware that Amazon is misleading. I ordered 2 copies of this game for different people as Christmas presents. As a pre-order promotion Amazon was offering a game code that would unlock additional game content. After the order was shipped I received 2 games but only one game code. Not really paying much attention to it (my fault) I printed out the game code and attached it inside the wrapped presents not noticing that there was only one code (in spite of the fact I bought and paid for 2 games). Upon discovering this (after) the boys (2 nephews) had opened their Christmas presents I immediately felt like a heal because one game code can not be used twice; hence one gets the upgrade one does not. On Christmas day (after they boys had opened their gifts (together) the problem was immediately obvious. So, I contacted Amazon asking for help but was informed that only one code per customer could be issued no matter how many games you ordered. WTF? What kind of BS is that? Where is the logic? With this experience I want to share with everyone that if you need to order multiple copies of the same game expecting to receive the same pre-order benefits don't do it with Amazon. Order yours and have others order additional games for you if you are going to buy from Amazon; or just buy from someone else. After contacting Amazon I have been told I can send any unopened games back... Like that is even an option. Amazon customer relations and marketing needs an enema. Now I have 2 little boys disappointed on Christmas day because if I give to one I can't give to the other. This is certainly the last time I will buy games from Amazon without playing their stupid games. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. Big middle finger to Amazon... shame on you Amazon!

Slower cards don't let me take as many pictures in quick sequence.  I also have a Samsung EVO class card.  Its speed ratings are slower than this card, but for my purposes I can't tell the difference in speed (both cards are fast enough for my camera).  The Samsung is slightly cheaper and comes with an adapter.  I recommend it over this card because of the price difference unless you need the extra speed this card offers.

16037	__label2__	5	Y	Baby	B005IOJ8J2	Trend Lab Nylon Bottle Bag, Blue (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Great bag at a great price!	I searched to find a smaller insulated bag for my son's toddler food. Most were over priced for what they were. I found this product and love it. It is super easy to wash out when things spill and fits in his diaper bag without taking up much space. Such a great bag...I can forsee this being used for future needs such as picnics or trips to the zoo even as the kiddos get older.

19715	__label2__	1	N	Outdoors	B000M0MJU2	Intex Raised Downy Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump, Queen, Bed Height 22"	Deflates/Don't Waste Your $$$	I went to the store to buy an aerobed and the sales person raved about this one so I purchased it... It's the worst mattress I've ever owned!!! It deflated half way through the night the first time I'd ever used it!!! I returned it thinking I got a defective one but the new one did the exact same thing!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!
12383	__label2__	3	Y	Grocery	B000NB3VFM	Airborne (New Zealand) Manuka Honey 500g / 17.85oz	Sweet taste and good price	I have been trying several brands of Manuka honey lately, trying to find the one that offers the most healing potential for the best price and I'm not sure that this is it. The UMF is lower than the other honey I am currently using. Though the Airborne honey has a lovely taste, I am not sure that the lower UMF is actually enough to heal anything. On the nights that I take a tsp of Airborne,I seem to have more congestion than when I use one of the other brands with a higher UMF. Also, the jar arrived with the top cracked and honey leaked all over the packaging. I'm  not sure if I will order this again.
15753	__label2__	4	Y	Jewelry	B009GTEJX0	Silver-Tone Nose Ring Hoop 5/16" 7.9mm Bali Style Design 22G	Nice-a bit big	I thought I'd like this hoop with the detail on, and I do, but I feel like it's a little too big for me and a little much sometimes.  With that being said, I do get compliments from people, so I think as long as I wear it confidently it looks good! I wish it were just a bit smaller.
17068	__label2__	3	Y	Home	B00KFT2ULI	5'X9.5' Military Flag Display Case Memorial with Personalized Brass Plaque and Frame Mat	Not Exactly What I Was Hoping For....	This display case is fairly attractive, but the quality of the workmanship isn't quite what I was hoping for, especially for the price I paid. The finish on the wood isn't completely even, and there is a small place on the front of the frame that shows where someone used a different shade of paint to cover up a flaw. Very disappointing. Also, it does not close tightly. The glass cover will shut, but it does not close air-tight. In fact, if the flag is not folded flat enough, the cover tends to pop open. I like the brass plate, and the engraving looks nice. In spite of the flaws, I decided to keep this because it had already been personalized and I wasn't sure a replacement would come out any better. The company who sells this was very professional and wrote me a nice email, thanking me for my purchase. I appreciate their conscientious customer service. But, the manufacturer of the frame could have created a better product with a little more effort.
12169	__label2__	1	Y	Tools	B0001WOKWQ	SOG Credit Card Companion with Lens/Compass ToolLogic CC1SB - 9 Tools, Black, 2" Blade	Look elsewhere... don't buy this	Wow, what a piece of garbage. Within 5 minutes of receiving this, which was 10 minutes ago, the knife broke off the handle. The compass does not work, the tweezers are a joke, and the bottle opener won't even come out of the case. This thing is a waste of time, money, and energy. DO NOT BUY IT!! It's not worth the hassle of sending it back. I'm going to chalk this up to experience.

I take it before breakfast, lunch and supper. I don't take the one after supper because I don't tend to eat much in the late evenings. I find it really cuts my down my appetite.

1391	__label1__	2	N	Grocery	B001E4S850	Skippy Peanut Butter, Creamy, 16.3-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)	Saturated fat	This product has palm oil in it, and as far as "vegetable" oils are concerned its one of the worst oils around. Yes, I suppose the palm oil is natural, but it's a saturated fat and it's NOT healthy. It also has added sugar. Other brands might be a better choice for health conscious consumers as it has only two ingredients, peanuts and salt.
1456	__label1__	3	N	Video DVD	B0084IG7KC	The Hunger Games (Blu-ray + Digital Copy)	A bit too commercial for my own tastes	The book was fantastic. But I would rate the movie with just an 'okay'. Let me tell you why. It fails in delivering the emotions that you could feel when reading the book. The characters in this movie are crafted after the nowadays heroes theme. And that's too commercial for my tastes. Indeed, the film delivers excelent entertainment and the effects are very realistic. It's a good movie, but the book is better.

17764	__label2__	5	N	Luggage	B002TO6WMU	AmeriLeather Leather Toiletry Bag - Dark Brown	A Classic	This was a birthday present from my sister & brother-in law. I loved this bag, it is by far the nicest toiletry bag I have ever owned. I love the way that it opens up like the old fashion doctors bag, and stays open. The leather is nice and thick and looks as it should last me a life time, the leather has a kind of already used look but in a good way if you know what I mean. I think the size is perfect, you can fill it with full size bottles of shampoo, shaving cream or what ever. I also like the zipper bottom compartment. This is a great bag the only mistake you could make is NOT buying it.

However, one leg had a bad finish, so had a replacement sent. This was a gift, so I wasn't very happy with having to switch out the leg a week later. However, it is very pretty and provides a nice amount of jewelry storage. You might even be able to use the larger drawers for undergarments!

16599	__label2__	5	Y	Camera	B000FU2AMG	OP/TECH USA 5301422 Bino/Cam Harness - Elastic	Great utility and value	Given its modest price, purchased this just to determine whether it could hold camera/binoculars more securely when trekking over difficult terrain (most recently, Patagonia) than using a standard strap (a heretofore favorite being the Op/Tec version long enough to allow the camera to swing on one side). The harness won out every day and was MUCH easier on shoulders and, even with elastic straps, minimized movement and resultant need to compensate when navigating uneven ground. Speaking of elastic, my camera, a relatively heavy Nikon D300 plus 18-300 lens (the heavier version) did cause significant stretching, but adjusting the straps compensated fully and still allowed full range of motion from chest to eye level. Best of all, even after a long day, I had forgotten just how heavy the camera/lens really really was. Finally, the Op/Tech connector system allows one to mix and match various devices for ease of handling and safety.<br />Cannot recommend highly enough.

I got an email back saying theyd do it and that they sent in my request. I just got it yesterday and it sits on my neck its so short, but i dont have the time to return it.

Very delicate chain and would be an excellent accessory to casual or cocktail wear. It would make an excellent gift, as it can be used when using casual wear or dress wear.  Make sure you buy the right size chain when considering it as a gift for someone, as the nine inch chain is very large.

It was not treated very well being stuffed in the back of land rovers etc.<br />The only thing that failed was one of the metal feet came off at some stage (the central one).  Other than that it hed up well and will definatley be my go to bag for trips.<br />My only criticism of the bag is the metal &#34;feet&#34;  which are only held on by what appears to be a split pin type device which can be felt on the interior of the bag and will wear through as they are not well covered on the interior.<br />Other than that great bag for the price and they are up to real world traveling.

Ha, amirite?	I purchased two of these and two of them arrived in a timely manner with more than adequate packaging. I put some Celestion Silver series speakers in there, I found that adding speakers to the cabinets really boosted the performance of them as sound enablers. Only complaint would be the hardware, the screws were too skinny for the speakers I had and the sinks for said screws were screwed on instead of sunk into the wood. Maybe there was a reason for that, I'm not a wood/screw/screw sink guy. I've used them at a couple of shows now and have wound up standing on one of them on more than one occasion because hey rock and roll I'll stay up past 10pm, I don't care. Reasonably priced and functional, plenty of speaker cable in place in addition to an easy install for the speakers (I wound up using the hardware from my old cabinet, though).<br /><br />No gypsy curses detected, so A+ in that category.
2243	__label1__	4	Y	Automotive	B004YHOB5U	Chemical Guys HOL_182 Foam Blaster Complete Car Wash Kit Foam System (8 Items)	Great except the foam gun	This was my first time using Chemical Guys products and I was pleasantly surprised. The cleaners work well and leave your car nice and squeaky clean. The citrus cleaner is the best cleaner, good for washing the car the day you plan to wax it. The gloss-works is best for cleaning a lightly soiled car, but does leave it wetter looking than the other washes. The big jug which I guess is a mix of the two runs right down the middle on cleaning power and gloss. The gloves are of good quality, particularly the microfiber glove. Those tend to fall apart or mold quickly here in Florida, but this one is still going strong.<br /><br />But the foam sprayer is of poor quality.<br />When this thing worked, it was great and I plan to buy another one, but will seek out a different brand. When I first got it, there was a missing part on the foamer (the hose/strainer that sucks up the soap). I called chemical guys directly to see if they would send me a replacement. They were very friendly and sent me one at no cost that arrived in only a few days. I was pretty impressed since I had actually purchased this through a third party vendor. The foamer worked like a champ for the first couple of months, but started leaking shortly after that. Then, the trigger started sticking so you couldn't stop the flow of foam. It became unusable within 6 months.

I also have the 4ft 6 bulb which produces quite a bit more light but also heat.  So it is a trade off, I don't know if this is enough to flower under, but for sure more than enough for small veg and mother plants.  If this is goin a small area you will still need some ventilation.
14562	__label2__	1	Y	Watches	B002NSKV92	Kenneth Cole New York Men's KC3898 Automatic Stainless Steel Bracelet Watch	Looks great but lasts less than a year :(	I bought this watch for my friend's birthday in July 2012. Today is February 14, 2013 and the watch simply gave up the ghost - it's now dead as a doornail. That sucks big time! It looks great and is quite unique, but it sure isn't worth buying since it lasted less than a year.

14912	__label2__	5	N	Sports	B00JU8GYT4	KettleX Intermediate Workout with Lorna Kleidman (Tutorial Included)	A solid workout routine	I've been using Kettlebells for ~ 15 years as part of my martial arts routine and know firsthand how useful these things can be for both men and women who want to strengthen and stabilize their core, burn fat, and build muscle. Sure, weights can do the same thing, but Kettlebells have certain advantages, not the least of which is that they're fun and easy to use. The kettlebell's center of mass is extended beyond the hand, hence utilizes more muscles than traditional dumbbells, meaning that a kettlebell workout is more effective and yields better results in less time too. What I hadn't found until now was useful instruction for those who have played around with them but want something more. Lorna Kleidman clearly knows her stuff, she is a 3-time Kettlebell World Champion, author, and coach, and it shows in the instruction. Ignoring the tutorial (~ 20 min) which you'll only need a couple of times, the DVD has a ~40 minute exercise routine, and ~ 4 minute cool down covering intermediate Kettlebell exercises. This makes for a well-produced, easy to follow, useful workout. You will need two Kettlebells for this routine (Lorna suggests ~ 10-15lb and 20-25lb for woman and ~ 15-20lb and 30-35lb for men) and a mat or towel, all of which are easily available at most any sporting goods store or online.

And if you did like elder scrolls this will disappoint.<br />Pros: Great graphics, Ok story/plot, multiplayer option.<br /><br />Cons: Bland gameplay. (Your character can only use certain weapons so a mage could only use magic and swordsman can only use swords, which is a big con. You could switch characters but it's not same thing.), Not that many skills to improve upon.

Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.<br />1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a "fat burner" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)

So, buying this one was a no brainer.  The car I bought it for is black with a black dash and it really gets hot when the sun's out.  The mat does a great job of keeping the interior cooler.  It also protects the dash from the damage that the sun could do to it.  And, I think the mat adds a nice touch to the car's interior because it breaks up the monotony of plastic everywhere.  The mat that I bought is well made and fits like it should.  Very easy to install using the supplied velcro strips.  I highly recommend Dash Mats!

10767	__label2__	3	N	Beauty	B00AE078YM	Clear 7 Day Intensive Treatment Tubes, Color and Damage Repair, 3.5 Fl Oz	Some improvement	I was actually surprised to see some results at the very end of this treatment.  I don't wash my hair every day so I used these tubes for 7 consecutive washes.  I didn't notice much difference during the first 5 tubes, in fact, my hair felt heavy and with some residue.  My hair is wavy but med/thin and it weighs down easily.  By the 6th and 7th tubes, I notice my hair was a bit bouncier and the frizz control had improved.  I didn't see a dramatic change, like super silky or shiny, but I did notice the almost no frizz - and we have had rainy days, so I know it helped.<br /><br />My hair is brown with some highlights.  This treatment didn't make the highlights dull or fade away (like other heavy treatments have done).  I didn't use a special shampoo, just used this treatment instead of conditioner (with longer waiting time).  I didn't use any other styling products either.  Each tube has plenty of `cream' and I wonder if a person with short hair would be able to use half the tube at a time.  My hair is about 3" below my shoulders now, and I could've used 2/3 of the tube and have plenty.<br /><br />Overall, the 7 'day' treatment improved my hair but didn't change it dramatically.

Thankfully the memory card saved the priceless nice photo's I took with this camera, however, the camera will have to be sent back under MFR warranty since it is not usable without the LED.<br /><br />Glad the pictures and the SD card saved the pictures, though am disappointed in it not working after just 2 outings and no misuse!

3904	__label1__	3	N	Video Games	B00BI83EVU	Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4	Fun-ish	Really wanted to like it, cause I think a videogame set in Chicago sounds AWESOME.  Unfortunately, the Chicago in this game is a weird not-really-Chicago.  Like there are mountains in this Chicago.  Among other things.<br /><br />That's a quibble, though, if the game had been super fun to play, I wouldn't have cared.  But so far (and I'm not QUITE finished with it), it's kind of a trudge.  Lot of similar mission types, lot of very loose driving, and a lot of very loose combat.  Loose is a generally good term for the game overall.<br /><br />Since it seems like this'll probably get a sequel one way or another, I'm hoping they can take all the cool fun things out of this one (THE HACKING) and polish them into something really good the next time around.  Worth it at 20-25 bucks tops, probably.

Yes, it does get a little hot with continuous use as other reviewers stated before.<br />I bought mine in October 2013, and it does remove HDCP protection (tested with a PS3) which is the main reason you might be taking a look at this item.<br />It is quite small and &#34;portable&#34; (sans the power supply) so you would have no problem hiding it.<br /><br />The main issue with my unit (perhaps defective?) is that the sound will either crack or just be gone completely. I'm yet to find out if the problem is due to the TV, the capture card ([[ASIN:B00840353W Elgato Game Capture HD (10025010)]]) or this unit, but in any case I don't lose too much sleep over it as I'm using optical audio to playback and record (as opposed to audio via HDMI) but it's definitely something you should have in mind, if not using the optical out port of whatever device you intend to capture.<br /><br />Overall it works for my purpose (HDCP breaking) and I'm happy with the product, but I already found a similar product (not on amazon so cannot link) that apparently works and doesn't require a power supply, so I might be heading towards that direction (the power supply is something I quite not like that much about this product, as it's one extra thing to be taking space on my -already getting crowded- UPS).<br /><br />I haven't had the chance to try 3D yet to see if it works, maybe when I do I'll come back and update the review.

17869	__label2__	3	Y	Video Games	B0056WJA30	Darksiders II - Xbox 360	Such a let down	The first Darksiders told a great story and had fantastic gameplay to accompany. Darksiders 2 continues the great story, but the gameplay is an enormous let down. There's much more of an RPG feel, as you can level up and explore a skill tree to develop your own style of play unlike the first game. You can collect random items dropped by monsters and "feed" normal items to "possessed" items in order to power them up.<br /><br />This is where the fun ends.<br /><br />The game is mostly played through combat, and the combat is poorly executed. Because of the random quality of the items that enemies drop, the attributes you take into combat are a grab bag at any given time and they rarely work for whatever monster you happen to come across. Pausing gameplay to switch your equipment to make up for this is just a disaster. It takes the pure adrenaline right out of the gameplay and just dumbs it down to... I don't even know. You have to stop, go through an equipment menu that's a pain to navigate because of how long it takes the game to actually frickin' respond to your input, and then find something that will work against your current opponent. It's just a disaster.<br /><br />Then there's the controls themselves. I've never played a game before that makes me constantly use the entire controller. I have had my hands contorted into some bizarre physical structures just trying to enter all the commands necessary to dodge, strike, use potions and/or use special skills, all of which have to be done pretty much at the same time or Death gets killed. You can dodge quickly, but you can't use it to cancel your current action (a SERIOUS disappointment given the utter non-ending frequency of enemy attacks). You can also only dodge three times in a row before Death decides to stop and catch his... breath? Really? The Nephilim called Death who is known for killing his entire kindred who are supposed to be the most powerful beings in existence needs to catch his breath because he dida few backflips? What? How DID this whimpy gasbag kill all his brethren?<br /><br />Then there's the fact that enemies attack almost constantly. Death - the aforementioned supremist of the supreme - has to stop regularly to catch his breath. Enemies? No so much. Most enemies in the game just keep on attacking, rarely doing anything that exposes them that doesn't result in an almost immediate counter attack that will catch Death before he can get back out of the way. They also don't stagger when you hit them - even with the most powerful weapons - if they're already in the middle of an attack. No so for death: no, mysteriously the supremist of the supreme gets interrupted very easily when attacking supposedly inferior enemies that don't share this flaw. A lot of the larger enemies attack in a series that not only follows Death, but outlasts and outstretches his ability to triple-dodge. Because combat is reduced to glorified button mashing, you'll frequently get stuck in one of the stupidly-long animations where Death throws his scythes in some spin out in front of him (seriously, if they magically come back, why can't they magically return to him wherever he dodges away to?) or does something else that leaves him vulnerable for an asinine amount of time.<br /><br />Combine the facts that the large track-you-down-and-hit-you-no-matter-what enemies almost ALWAYS appear in groups with other smaller wall-of-never-ending-attack type minions, and that Death can't cancel actions to dodge and can't block at all and you're guaranteed one thing: Death is going to take damage, and he's going to take a lot of it.<br /><br />Combat also takes a lot of time. Enemies just absorb ridiculous amounts of damage. It doesn't matter if you have the most powerful weapons you've seen so far. You have to hit even the most basic enemies a truly absurd number of times. Even if you go back to the very first stage when you're level 20 with Super Powerful Weapons, you still don't have one-hit kills because the enemies just have a ridiculous amount of health at all points in the game. The Crucible is a nightmare because it's just wave after wave of groups of enemies that take serious punishment while each being able to kill Death in a mere couple of hits.<br /><br />Seriously. Combat in this game is just horrible. It's like it's designed to piss off the player. I wouldn't have minded CHALLENGING. But this isn't challenging. It's just purely frustrating. And it's a huge part of the game, because it's an action game. And that makes the whole game suck.<br /><br />Moving on from combat, the controls suck just as bad when doing puzzle solving and platforming. When wall jumping, timing is everything, but you often have to jump around corners or through bizarre camera-shifts that change the meaning of the direction you're pushing on the controller. However, when the screen shifts like this and you haven't taken a moment to let go of the directional stick, the controls will not update to the new camera context. So the direction Death moves in on-screen makes NO sense from any context, and he usually ends up falling to his death. Despite the fact that he takes no damage from long falls, he still falls to his death... When the camera switches, you have to take this bizarre moment out of your critical timing to completley let go of the directional stick and start from scratch, or the controls just end up being completely random when the screen finishes moving.<br /><br />This is also true of jumping from hand hold to hand hold. If you know the exact direction you have to move next and push the jump button the moment you land on the new handhold, it's a completely random event as to whether Death will continue to jump in the same direction or will - for unknown reasons - jump straight up from the hand hold you're on. But it's almost NEVER the direction you intended him to move in. It's like he just ignores the directional pad altogether and does what he feels like. Andsince there's no often a very robust choice of directions to move in, this random-but-not-what-you-told-me approach means he jumps to a non-existent handhold and falls to his doom. You HAVE to pause, even briefly, on each ledge and let the controls catch up before proceeding to the next. This. Is. Stupid. Especially when you can see and know exactly where you need to go. Why make me artificially wait? Why?<br /><br />Also, you're supposed to be able to push a button to automatically drop from your current handhold to one below it: whether or not this works as advertised is a crap shoot. Most of the time, you have to hold up - but only AFTER you drop from your initial perch, otherwise what Death does is completely random! He may just decide to jump from the wall altogether rather than just drop down even though you didn't push the button to jump! - or he won't grab the ledge below. And even then, whether or not he Actually Does What You Tell Him is another random event. Sometimes, no matter what you do, Death just sails right on by that lower ledge and falls straight to his doom.<br /><br />Sometimes you have to swing along a series of hoops like Gabriel Belmont does in Castlevania. In Castlevania, if you were in mid-jump the grapple points would always take precedence over any other available target because the game designers knew that if it didn't, Gabriel would fall to his death and that would be that. No so much in this game. There are a few places where there will be enemies near Deathgrip points. Even if the enemy is behind that point, Death will grab the enemy instead of the grapple point, which usually results in him pulling the enemy to himself. So great. Now you're in mid-air and have a pulled an enemy up to yourself so that it can die along with you as you both fall. Awesome.<br /><br />These crappy, unpredictable controls make a nightmare out of one particular scene in which the developers torture you with a camera-swinging climb up a tower that involvesdropping to a lower ledge as a floor of fire rises to chase you, but is almost always right behind you no matter where you are and how fast you've moved. The controls are just awful in this scene. Half the time, Death will do something random despite the fact that you're pressing the direcitonal pad in the correct direction - which you determine to be the correct one by taking a moment out of your precious little available time to let go of the controls and try from scratch. Sometimes, Death will need to go to the left, and you'll be holding left, but when you press the jump button he goes straight up the wall for some unknown reason. This wastes a lot of precious time as this stupidity CANNOT be cancelled once started and ends with some bizarre, useless move where Death just hangs on the wall for an extra super-long moment at the height of his jump. Sometimes, despite the fact that you would never, ever push the controls in any direction to cause this, Death just jumps straight out from the wall and into the middle of the tower and thus unto the firey floor and thus to his end. And because of how fast the floor moves, and the fact that the camera in the game CONSTANTLY fights against you, you can't get a good look to know the whole stage. You have to play through it repeatedly, dying becuase Death won't do the right thing and you're afraid to take the time to pause to make him. I hate scenes like this. Just a fraction of a second more on each hand hold would have made it a comfortable, challenging experience, but the way it was done made it frustrating because it's just too friggin' easy to makes mistakes and it's all due to the crappy controls. I had to replay this scene more times than any other in the game because the platforming is just so poorly done.<br /><br />This game just lacks the polish that made the first one great. It's almost unplayable at times. I'm no longer looking forward to the rest of this series. I might still play them if Darksders 2 wows mewith its end, which I haven't gotten to yet because the gameplay is so horribly "That's Not What I Friggin' Told You To Do" frustrating. But right now, I feel like I wasted my money. This game is just a serious disappointment on the heels of its predecessor, which made it to my favorites shelf.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />I've beaten the game, and as such I decided to add some detail.<br /><br />The game forces two playthroughs to get all the achievements, as one achievement is level-based but there's a level cap on the first playthrough. However, if you played through the first time on Apopacalyptic, the second time through will be much easier. There's no achievement for the Nightmare setting you unlock after the first go, which is great because Nightmare just makes Death's death permanent should you fall in battle. That would be controller-chucking frustrating since, as I've stated earlier, the controls are horrible and you WILL experience the game-over screen more than once no matter what you do.<br /><br />When you start New Game+, you get to keep all of Death's items, which means you start the game over with your end-game gear and thus a huge advantage. Toward the end of the first playthrough, you'll be offered weapons with health and wrath steal, which are pretty much required weapon attributes to make it through the end of the game because of the sheer amount of damage Death takes. The wimpy little heal-over-time health potions - and the fact that you can only carry 5 - just don't heal like weapons with health steal. Like I said earlier, enemies absorb ridiculous amounts of damage, often only losing a fraction of their health bars when Death hits them with a critical for nearly 3 times his own full health. So even a 10% health steal will usually replenish at least 20% if not nearly 50% of Death's health with a single attack, and it does so instantly. By the end of the second playthrough, that health steal will max out at 30%, which is insane life-granting ability for Death. You can stand among the waves of enemies, not even bothering to use the crappy dodge because your attacks will almost always heal back what enemies dish out. It really does take a huge edge off the combat, even if it absolutely incredibly stupid that the combat is set up in such a way as to require it.<br /><br />This leads me to talk more about the items themselves. Throughout the game, you'll find or be awarded "legendary" weapons. Most of the time, these weapons are many levels below the level Death had to be just to get to them. They also tend to have very limited attributes, and their "special ability" effects are laughable compared to the effects you can create with a possessed weapon. Most "special abilities" don't really do anything that you can tell is happening, rendering the weapon less apparently effective than even the most basic current-level random enemy-dropped weapon. There is exactly ONE in the game that you'll ever find useful: Achidna's Fangs. These have the only health-steal ability you'll get that's worth anything until really late in the game, and they also have an increased critical chance. On your first playthrough, you'll find yourself leaving them equipped until you can make your own more effective health-steal weapons because they really are a life-saver. Aside from that, every other "legendary" weapon hits for less damage, has incredibly weak attributes if any, and has a neglible and ineffective "special ability" compared to the possessed weapon you probably had to make to get through the quest or area to get to said "legendary" weapon. I tried every single one I could find, and usually reverted almost instantly to my existing weapon because it was always considerably more effective.<br /><br />Even with these vastly superior weapons and armor, Death can still be interrupted by just about anything while almost every enemy has some attack sequence that is really, really hard to stop once it starts. Even in the middle of the second playthrough, I was hitting enemies with criticals so high it was taking 1/3 of their health, and they would still just drop back and begin charging up some attack and let it loose as though I didn't exist and wasn't laying into them. Meanwhile, the supposed supremist-of-the-supreme hero of the story gets interrupted by the smallest of enemies dealing so little damage you can't even tell his health bar changed. This makes combat in the first playthrough just excruciating and annoying, but doesn't really come into effect in the second playthrough since enemies aren't really any more powerful but Death is both a higher level and has even better equipment. However, because Death is so much more powerful, it's just a gnawing annoyance and an asinine "feature" of combat that even basic enemies can't be interrupted without actually being killed because, well, eff you that's why.<br /><br />There's also this annoying achievement for sending a gift to a friend. None of my XBLA friends play this game, or many of the same games I do for that matter. Fortunately, I have a handful of profiles on my box from times when friends have come over and played Halo, so I just loaded one up and started the game to give that "player" an inbox and then went back to my real profile and sent "them" an item just to get the achievement. Seriously? I don't like when games try to force multiplayer on you to get achievements because it usually results in time-wasting like this. I just don't like games that force some kind of multiplayer - or even replays - becuase I strongly believe that these things should stand on their own merits and your in-game achievements should be your own. You shouldn't have to rely on other people to get their lives in line with yours so you can fully enjoy a game you bought for yourself.<br /><br />Overall, the second playthrough makes up for much of the furstration from the first. Thankfully, you don't have to play all the way through to mop up those final achievements: you just have to get to level 30 and beat Wicked K. Even so, it's a forced replay of an overall poorly executed game and it would have been better if I could have been one-and-out.

I have been searching for a large capacity mp3 style player. I have tried iPod Classic, too small screen for my taste. iPhone 32GB is small for my music/video collection. Having used iPhone 3GS and Nexus One Android 2.1/2.2, I have been thinking of any OS tablet style device. 7" is excellent for my requirement. While searching I stumbled on Archos 70/101 line and I was amazed they had a 250 GB hard disk model!  Salient points/comments/improvements for Archos 70 250 GB model:    Form factor is great, weight is not an issue. You can definitely see the hard disk spinning/humming slightly on the HD model. Flash model will not have this issue.It would have been great if they have this hybrid model where they have 4 GB and rest Hard disk for storage. This will speed up things definitely. A Optional SDHC card slot like in flash model will be very desirable. Since this is not Google blessed, there is no Android Google marketplace. So one has to install the hack given below in reference section. However this is very easy for people who are used to hacking/computer savvy. It may seem difficult for novice users, but it is very easy. The device/software is definitely not smooth if there are many apps running/lot of data churning. I have reboot it multiple times, but still it does not take away the usefulness of the product. As long as you don't run random apps and try one at a time install/test/remove/keep approach you are fine. When I connected the device to a PC using USB cable, it reboot and then came up and gave option to mount USB. I had no idea why it rebooted. I live with this sort of thing for past 20 years, so it is not a issue for me.  The Music player capability which is my main reason for getting it. There were some bumps in the Updating Multimedia library after copying files. It detected only 900 out of 5000+ files. I did a Reset Multimedia library and it fixed the issue. Took around 0.3 seconds to scan afile. So 6000 files = 6000 * 0.3 /60 = 30 minutes. This is reasonable and ok. Everytime I add music/pictures/videos I may have to run this if it does not incrementally find files. I am not sure how Android indexing media files works. The sound quality is amazing. There are two speakers on either side of tablet in landscape mode. Skype call works and I can make phone calls from this. This is very handy. Youtube is great, playback is good. I have only 802.11g, and wifi connectivity is good. I have powersave set to Overdrive. Gaming experience is great. Angry Birds! I am not playing games involving lot of accelerometer as moving device vigorously will affect hard disk. I am curious how hard disk is caged and sealed to device. Still moving head is a concern. I am not a big gamer of action/arcade games, so it is not a deal breaker for me. My main reason for getting this is storage!  I had all 90GB of music in lala.com and Apple acquired and killed the service.    Accessories: NOOKcolor eBook Pocket case cover, Bluetooth GPS Receivers, Phone for tethering or MiFi make it complete. Case/Google Navigation/Always on mobile. I tether to my Nexus One using portable hotspots which is a froyo feature.  With its limitations it is good. I wish they polish those 20% of areas and make it a good device.

It's over $5 more expensive than the brand of organic ceremonial matcha (product of Japan) 1 oz tin that I purchased last month. Kenko's is not any better. In fact I felt that the kenko one has more of a bitter taste to it rather than less!
