Given the following three pipeline phases, please respond where each phase starts and ends. 
You only need to return an array for each phase with two numerical values, 
the start line and end line. The imports should be included in a specific phase. 
All the code should fit into one of the four phases, with the exception of some model code that should be ommitted.

The four phases and a quick description are:
Data Preperation:
	- relevant imports used for the following.
	- Loading Data
	- Filtering or removing outliers
	- Handling missing values
	- standardizing, splitting or stripping data
	- Although data is cleaned, data is still in its original format

Data Featurisation:
	- relevant imports used for the following.
	- One hot encoding data
	- Sentence embeddings
	- Computing new features
	- Occurs after data is prepared and cleaned
	- Creates new columns
	- Data is in numerical values

Label extraction:
	- Label extraction involves identifying or generating the target variable (y) from raw data.
	- This step precedes any feature engineering or model training.
	- It's part of structuring the dataset into features (X) and labels (y), which is a fundamental task in preparing the data.

Model training:
	- relevant imports used for the following.
	- Ml model is instantiated
	- Loss function might be defined
	- Do not include the Model being fitted!
	- Do not include the Model being evaluated!
	- Do not include the Model being saved!
	- THis will result in additional code, please do not include this as part of the response

Return your answer as:
{
  "data_preparation": [start_line, end_line],
  "data_featurisation": [start_line, end_line],
  "label extraction" : [start_line, end_line],
  "model_training": [start_line, end_line]
}
